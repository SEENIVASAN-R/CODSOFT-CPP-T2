CONCEPT OF SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Introduction: The multi-operand calculator is an interactive program designed to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division across multiple inputs. It utilizes the result of each calculation as the starting point for the next operation, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.

Steps: Display Title: The program welcomes the user with a descriptive title and a clear menu of operations to guide them through the process.

Input Handling: The program accepts user inputs for numbers and operation choices, with built-in validation to handle invalid entries gracefully.

Arithmetic Operations: It performs basic arithmetic calculations, including:

Addition for summing values. Subtraction for finding differences. Multiplication for calculating products. Division with safeguards to prevent division by zero. Dynamic Chaining: The result of each operation is stored and used as the initial operand for the next calculation, allowing continuous operations without restarting the program.

Error Management:

Invalid operation selection prompts a single clear warning message, ensuring user clarity. Division by zero is managed with an informative error message, preventing program crashes. Exit Mechanism: An option to exit is provided, displaying the final result before the program concludes.

Properties Used:

Input Validation: Ensures all user inputs are valid and provides appropriate feedback for incorrect inputs. Error Handling: Manages exceptional cases like division by zero or invalid choices smoothly. Loop Control: Enables repeated operations until the user decides to exit. Dynamic State Management: Tracks and updates the ongoing result for continuous calculations. 

Conclusion: This multi-operand calculator showcases fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input validation, and error handling. It is a powerful example of building user-friendly and interactive computational tools.
